# Promise me a modal

**Preparation:**

- install the dependencies by typing this command in the terminal: npm i
- use the command: 'npm run serve' to run the project.

**Instructions**

- Create a promise that, once resolved, displays a modal to the user after the user spends 60 seconds on the page.
- The modal already exists in index.html but is currently hidden.
- Only work in index.js
- Note: no need to use the reject option since we only need the resolve function for this exercise.

- **BONUS** The user should be able to close the modal somehow :)
